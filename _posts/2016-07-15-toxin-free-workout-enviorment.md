Toxin-Free Workout Enviorment

When your muscles are exerting all the force they can muster - which is possible anytime during the movement thanks to gravity-less resistance. Your body will be taking in a lot more oxygen to match the requirements of your body at that time.

In modern 'unoptimized gyms' there are a lot of toxins in your bio-sphere that will affect your body system. 

We use organic methods to cleaj that support good bacteria in our facility. We use HEPA Filteration to clear out any allergens above x microns.

Treat your biosphere with Optimized Training from Optimized Fitness.
